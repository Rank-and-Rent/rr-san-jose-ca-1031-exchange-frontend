# 1031 Exchange San Jose

## Taxonomy Rationale

This site uses a comprehensive taxonomy designed to support nationwide replacement property identification for 1031 exchanges with a focus on single tenant retail and net lease properties. The service taxonomy includes 25 services organized into seven categories: Timelines, Structures, Execution, Tax, Reporting, Property Paths, and Education. This structure addresses the full lifecycle of a 1031 exchange from initial identification through final reporting. The location taxonomy includes 20 locations within 30 to 45 miles of San Jose, California, plus a remote option to support nationwide property identification. The property type taxonomy covers 16 single tenant retail property types suitable for 1031 exchanges, including all eight untouchable categories (convenience store gas c store, drive thru QSR, pharmacy, dollar store, coffee drive thru, auto parts retail, hard discount grocer, ground lease outparcel) plus selections from core focus, strong additions, and niche specialist tiers. This taxonomy enables investors to find single tenant retail and net lease replacement properties across property types and geographic markets while maintaining compliance with Section 1031 requirements. The layout diversity system ensures each service and location page uses a unique layout variant, preventing template fatigue and improving user engagement through varied presentation styles.
