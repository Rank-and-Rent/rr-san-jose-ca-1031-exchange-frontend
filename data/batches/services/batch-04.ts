    mainDescription:
      "<p>Triple net lease investments offer a distinctive combination of stability, passive income generation, and long-term growth potential that few other asset categories can match. These properties provide a secure pathway to building wealth, whether you're seeking portfolio diversification, reliable cash flow, or leveraging 1031 exchange tax advantages.</p><p>Understanding triple net lease structures: When you purchase a commercial building and enter into a lease agreement where a single tenant agrees to pay net property taxes, net insurance premiums, net property maintenance expenses, base rent, utilities, and most other operational costs, you own a triple net lease property. These creditworthy tenants are typically essential retailers, dollar stores, fast-food establishments, gas station convenience store combinations, pharmacies, and medical companies that maintain investment-grade credit ratings from S&P and Moody's.</p><p>There are two primary types of triple net leases: absolute NNN and regular NNN. Absolute NNN leases are long-term corporate-guaranteed agreements where tenants assume complete financial responsibility for all property expenses, including capital expenditures. Regular NNN leases still require tenants to pay taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance, but may include clauses requiring landlords to cover certain expenses like parking lot maintenance, roof repairs, or structural work. Ground leases represent a third category, involving land-only rentals lasting 20 to 99 years where tenants develop and maintain improvements.</p><p>Our net lease property identification service helps San Jose investors locate these stable income-producing assets nationwide. We search retail, office, and industrial markets to find properties with credit-rated tenants, extended lease terms, and consistent cash flows. We evaluate lease structures, tenant credit profiles, property conditions, and market positioning to identify opportunities that align with your exchange strategy. The service includes coordination with Qualified Intermediaries to ensure proper escrow handling and exchange documentation throughout the 45 day identification period and 180 day acquisition period.</p>",

        question: "What is a net lease property?",
        answer:
          "A net lease property is a single tenant property where the tenant pays base rent plus property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Triple net lease properties provide passive income with minimal landlord responsibilities. We help San Jose investors identify net lease properties that qualify for 1031 exchanges.",

      {
        question: "What types of businesses use triple net leases?",
        answer:
          "Triple net lease properties are typically occupied by recession-resistant, pandemic-resistant businesses tied to lifestyle trends and essential needs rather than economic cycles alone. Common tenants include auto parts stores, convenience stores, childcare centers, car washes, dollar stores, drug stores, fast-food restaurants, gas stations, medical clinics, pet and veterinary clinics, and quick-service restaurants. These businesses have demonstrated profitability even during challenging economic periods.",

        question: "What are the financial advantages of NNN investments?",
        answer:
          "NNN investments offer relatively low entry barriers, typically ranging from $1 million to $5 million, though smaller or higher-value properties exist. They provide reliable, relatively low-risk investments that generate long-term monthly income. The passive, predictable income can be shaped to fit financial, lifestyle, and geographical preferences. With billion-dollar corporation tenants, ownership risk is reduced. You receive 10 to 20+ years of reliable income with little to no landlord responsibility, periodic rent escalations, prime tenant-selected locations, tangible asset value, tax opportunities through 1031 exchanges and cost segregation, portfolio diversification, and lifestyle freedom without active management.",
