    mainDescription:
      "<p>Our 200 percent rule strategy service helps San Jose investors identify multiple replacement properties while staying within IRS value limits. Under the 200 percent rule, you can identify any number of replacement properties if their combined value does not exceed 200 percent of your relinquished property value. This provides flexibility beyond the three property rule when you want to evaluate multiple options. We help you calculate value limits, structure your identification list, and rank properties by investment quality. Our team coordinates with Qualified Intermediaries to ensure proper identification documentation and provides timeline support throughout the 45 day identification period and 180 day acquisition period. The service includes explanation of identification rules, value calculation support, and coordination with brokers and Qualified Intermediaries throughout the exchange process.</p>",

        question: "What is the 200 percent rule?",
        answer:
          "The 200 percent rule allows you to identify any number of replacement properties if their combined value does not exceed 200 percent of your relinquished property value. This provides more flexibility than the three property rule for San Jose investors who want to evaluate multiple options.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I calculate the 200 percent limit?",
        answer:
          "Multiply your relinquished property sale price by two to determine the maximum combined value of identified replacement properties. For example, if you sold a property for two million dollars in San Jose, CA, you can identify properties with a combined value up to four million dollars under the 200 percent rule.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I identify properties exceeding 200 percent?",
        answer:
          "If the combined value of identified properties exceeds 200 percent of your relinquished property value, your identification may be invalid unless you qualify for the 95 percent exception. We help San Jose investors structure identification to stay within limits and ensure compliance.",

      {
        question: "How does the 200 percent rule compare to the three property rule?",

          "The three property rule allows up to three properties of any combined value. The 200 percent rule allows any number of properties but limits combined value to 200 percent. We help San Jose investors choose the best identification strategy based on their property options and investment objectives.",

          "Boot is any non-like-kind value received in a 1031 exchange, such as cash or debt relief. Boot is taxable up to the amount of realized gain. The 200 percent rule helps structure identification but does not eliminate boot risk. We help San Jose investors understand boot exposure and coordinate with tax advisors.",
