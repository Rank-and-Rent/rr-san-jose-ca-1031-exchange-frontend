        question: "What are the different types of triple net leases?",
        answer:
          "There are two primary categories: absolute NNN leases and regular NNN leases. Absolute NNN leases are long-term corporate-guaranteed agreements where tenants assume complete financial responsibility for all property expenses, including capital expenditures. Regular NNN leases still require tenants to pay taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance, but may include clauses requiring landlords to cover certain expenses like parking lot maintenance, roof repairs, or structural work. Ground leases represent a third category, involving land-only rentals lasting 20 to 99 years where tenants develop and maintain improvements.",

      {
        question: "What tenant credit ratings do you track?",
        answer:
          "We identify NNN properties featuring investment-grade tenants rated BBB or higher by major credit agencies, along with strong regional operators. For San Jose exchanges, we emphasize properties with reliable tenant credit profiles and extended lease durations that provide income stability.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I exchange into NNN properties from other property types?",
        answer:
          "Yes. NNN properties qualify as like-kind real property for 1031 exchange purposes. We help San Jose investors identify NNN replacement properties when exchanging from multifamily, industrial, retail, or other real property types.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the benefits of NNN properties for 1031 exchanges?",
        answer:
          "NNN properties deliver passive income streams, credit tenant security, and long-term lease stability. These attributes make them attractive replacement properties for San Jose investors seeking low-maintenance investments in California and nationwide. Additional advantages include relatively low entry barriers, predictable monthly income, minimal landlord responsibilities, periodic rent increases, prime tenant-selected locations, tangible asset value, tax benefits through 1031 exchanges and cost segregation, portfolio diversification opportunities, and lifestyle flexibility without active property management.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are there any drawbacks to NNN investments?",
        answer:
          "If you prefer hands-on property management, the lack of management responsibilities might be considered a drawback. Additionally, rent amounts are contractually fixed for specified periods, though many leases include annual or periodic increases. When factoring in minimal maintenance requirements, tax advantages, and land appreciation potential, rent caps typically don't significantly impact overall returns.",
