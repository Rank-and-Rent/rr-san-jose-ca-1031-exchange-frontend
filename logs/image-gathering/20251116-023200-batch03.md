## Notes
- All images verified as landscape orientation (width >= height)
- All images filtered to exclude maps, commercial real estate sites, and watermarked images
- Images sourced from Bing Images using large image filter
- Menlo Park image replaced after initial portrait orientation was detected
- Remote location skipped as it represents a service type rather than a physical location
